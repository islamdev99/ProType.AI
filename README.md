Here's the updated README formatted as a single "code block" message with adjusted spacing and alignment for better readability. I've ensured consistent spacing between sections, aligned emojis, and maintained a clean structure. Since this is plain text, I'll simulate the dimensions using spaces and line breaks effectively.
